This is from my [Marvin3 project home](http://sourceforge.net/projects/marvin3/).
Marvin has evolved into Marvin3 and is becoming ready to be tried by the audience.
In order to make it better known, and because it is free software, I requested a SourceForge account yesterday, and to my surprise my request was approved in a couple of hours (*while I was led to believe that it would take two days!!!*).
Well, I am happy for that, and I released Marvin3 0.0.6 which has some way to go; but it is still somewhat usable (or triable???).

This release of Marvin3 includes the interpreter command-line, as well as a GUI called Mice (*Marvin3 Interactive Command Environment*).
If you want to have a look, be sure you have [Python](http://www.python.org) 2.4.1 and [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org) 2.6.1 (*if you intend to use the Mice GUI*).
Mice GUI seems to work OK with WinXP (*with some quirks*) but having problems with GNOME 2.10 (on Ubuntu 5.04).
Most probably, this is because of the old version of wxPython shipped with Ubuntu 5.04.
Later I will post a Win32 binary release and try to release an Debian/Ubuntu deb.
Anyway, you can download Marvin3 0.0.6 from [Marvin3 project home](http://sourceforge.net/projects/marvin3/).
The zip file has a few sample Marvin3 programs (*but it is ridiculously few, next release will be serious about this*), so you can try them and even tell me your opinions.

That's all folks (for now)...
