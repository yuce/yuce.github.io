Last week, I received 20 (1 install + 1 live) Ubuntu Linux 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog) CDs *FOR FREE* (details will follow).
Of course in no time I installed it. I have to say that Hoary rocks!
I was using Warthy before, and this new release fixes the few problems Warthy had (e.g., my Kingston USB-disk is now recognized, and my computer turns off when I log out.)

The new version of Ubuntu, [Breezy Badger](http://www.ubuntu.com/newsitems/5.10preview) is on its way out but let me write some of the features of Hoary:

* [Python 2.4.1](http://www.python.org/2.4.1/), the latest version for now.
* [GNOME 2.10](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.10/), not the latest version (*2.12 will be included in Breezy*) but works perfectly.
* [Firefox 1.02](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/), not the latest version but it is updated easily in Windows Update style.
* Synaptic package manager that makes install/update/uninstall a snap.
* *much more...*

Well, after installation of the base system, I ran Synaptic and downloaded other software I frequently use, such as [wxPython](http://wxpython.org) for GUI programming with Python (*2.5.3.2pre is the latest in the repository though, I hope 2.6.1.0 will be available soon*),
[Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) (1.06) for reading my mail (*Evolution 2.2 is installed by default*).

Now the *FOR FREE* part... Most Linux distros are downloadable for free, but Ubuntu won't charge anything even sending the CDs to you in reasonable quantities.
There are people who asked for and received 100 CDs! I was not greedy that much however, so I only asked for 20.
If you are nearby [EMU](http://www.emu.edu.tr) [Department of Computer Engineering](http://cmpe.emu.edu.tr) room 124, you may take one free from me.
Or you may order some CDs for yourself at [Ubuntu shipit](http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org/).
Don't forget to read the [FAQ](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/shipit/) though.
(*Note: The CD distribution is closed until the release of Breezy, which will be releason on October.*)
